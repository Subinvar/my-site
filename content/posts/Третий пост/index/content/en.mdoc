# Cutting burn-on defects on aluminium castings

An aluminium foundry struggled with heavy burn-on across gearbox housings. One in four castings needed manual grinding, and during peak season the scrap pile kept growing.

## What was going wrong

- The release coating formula could not handle the furnace temperature profile.
- Operators applied the coating inconsistently, from thin 20 µm films to thick 80 µm spots.
- Mould drying was judged by eye with no instrumentation to confirm readiness.

## Our playbook

1. Ran lab trials with three coating candidates and selected a mix with higher thermal shock resistance.
2. Introduced a two-stage application: dip first, then blow off excess with compressed air to stabilise the layer at 45±5 µm.
3. Installed infrared sensors so the drying cycle stops automatically at 180 °C mould temperature.

## Outcomes

- Burn-on fell from 24% to 6% within the first month.
- Average machining time per casting dropped by 11 minutes.
- Annual savings on abrasives and manual rework add up to ₽3.8 million.

## Next steps

We documented the coating control routine and handed over operator checklists. The next milestone is linking CCTV analytics with the sensors to monitor coating thickness in real time.
