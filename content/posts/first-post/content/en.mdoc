# Reducing burn-on on an aluminium line

To eliminate burn-on defects and stabilise core strength we introduced a new binder and redesigned the release coating process. Together with the customer engineers we ran iterative trials until the surface parameters stayed consistent.

{% callout type="warning" title="Key takeaway" %}
The right coating viscosity and dwell time after dipping cut burn-on by 40% and saved 18 minutes of cleaning per shift.

## Project steps

- Analysed the sand mix in the lab and selected a low-emission binder system.
- Tuned the spray equipment and trained operators to control coating thickness.
- Implemented a joint Intema Group quality checklist and weekly audits.

{% alert tone="success" title="Outcome" %}
Rework volume dropped by 32% and release coating consumption decreased by 12% thanks to viscosity optimisation.
