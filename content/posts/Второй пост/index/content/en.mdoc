# Modernising the moulding lines

Over the past two years we have revamped three cold-box moulding lines for a customer in the Samara region. The goal was to ramp u
p pump housing output without hiring extra staff or expanding floor space.

## Findings at kickoff

- Mixer wear reached 18%; liquid silicate dosing fluctuated within ±7%.
- Cores failed to hold a 12-hour window: strength dropped to 0.48 MPa instead of the required 0.6 MPa.
- CO₂ emissions exceeded the compliance limit by 14%.

## Action plan

1. Switched the shop to a low-viscosity binder system with a modified catalyst package.
2. Added an automated dosing control unit with feedback from lab sensors.
3. Set up a preventive maintenance programme: we track component wear every 800 hours and calibrate spray nozzles.

## Project economics

| Metric | Before upgrade | After upgrade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Average daily output | 820 housings | 1,160 housings |
| Unit production cost | ₽1,980 | ₽1,620 |
| Line utilisation | 91% | 78% |

## Next steps

We are now scaling the project to the neighbouring gas-treatment bay. The plan is to add real-time temperature monitoring and roll 
out the new sand formulation across the area by October.
