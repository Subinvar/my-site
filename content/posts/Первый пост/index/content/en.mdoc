# Reducing burn-on on an aluminium line

To eliminate burn-on defects and stabilise core strength we introduced a new binder and redesigned the release coating process. Together with the customer engineers we ran iterative trials until the surface parameters stayed consistent.

## Project steps

- Analysed the sand mix in the lab and selected a low-emission binder system.
- Tuned the spray equipment and trained operators to control coating thickness.
- Implemented a joint Intema Group quality checklist and weekly audits.
