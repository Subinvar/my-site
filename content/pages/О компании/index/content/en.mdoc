# About Intema Group

Intema Group supplies materials and technical solutions for the foundry industry. We help foundries stabilise mould and core production, reduce scrap, and make processes more predictable.

Our focus is binder systems, release coatings, and auxiliary materials for core and mould production. We work not only with products themselves, but also with their application: we support plant trials, take part in start-ups, and help adapt the technology to real shop-floor conditions.

## Who we work with

We support teams responsible for the stability of foundry operations:

- foundry shops and core / moulding departments;
- production managers and shop supervisors;
- process engineers and quality specialists;
- purchasing and sourcing professionals.

Typical challenges we are asked to solve:

- unstable core and mould strength;
- excessive scrap caused by burn-on, penetration, or gas defects;
- difficulties when switching to new materials or processes;
- lack of technical support from existing suppliers.

## How we work

Our approach is to be more than just a “material vendor”:

1. **Initial assessment.** We collect data on alloys, equipment, current process parameters, and typical defects.
1. **Material selection.** We recommend binders, coatings, and auxiliaries tailored to your processes and casting requirements.
1. **Trials and start-up.** We support plant trials, help tune process parameters, and document stable operating windows.
1. **Training and support.** We brief operators and engineers, provide application guidelines, and stay available for technical questions.
1. **Ongoing cooperation.** When needed, we visit the plant, help resolve non-standard issues, and adapt solutions as production changes.

## Geography and logistics

We work with foundries across Russia and neighbouring countries. Our logistics are organised to deliver materials on time and in the required quantities.

Deliveries are planned with the specifics of foundry operations in mind: seasonality, planned shutdowns, and stock level requirements, so that you do not face production stops due to material shortages.

## Why it is convenient to work with us

We aim to be a technical partner rather than just another supplier:

- **Technical support.** We assist with process design, support trials, and help analyse scrap causes.
- **Reliable deliveries.** We plan shipments together with customers to keep materials available when they are actually needed.
- **Transparent terms.** We openly discuss lead times, pricing, and quality expectations and document clear agreements.
- **Tender support.** We help prepare the technical part of proposals and choose optimal solutions for tender requirements.
- **Long-term partnership.** We focus on long-term cooperation and project development, not one-off deliveries.
