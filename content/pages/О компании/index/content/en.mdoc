# About Intema Group

Intema Group supplies binder systems, mould and core coatings and auxiliary materials for foundry production. We help foundries stabilise their processes, reduce scrap and make output more predictable.

## Company profile

Intema Group is a Russian company focused on materials and solutions for the foundry industry. From our facilities in the Moscow region we organise deliveries to foundries across Russia and neighbouring countries.

Our portfolio covers:

- binder systems for various core and moulding processes;
- mould and core coatings, water-based and alcohol-based;
- auxiliary products that help keep the process under control.

We work not only with products themselves, but also with their application technology — supporting trials, ramp-up and fine-tuning under real production conditions.

## Who we work with

We cooperate with teams responsible for the stability of foundry operations:

- foundry shops and core making departments;
- production managers and shop supervisors;
- process engineers and quality engineers;
- procurement and supply specialists.

Typical situations where customers come to us:

- unstable strength of moulds and cores;
- increased scrap due to burn-on and gas defects;
- difficulties when introducing new materials or changing the process;
- lack of technical support from the supplier.

Our role is to help remove these bottlenecks and make the process stable week after week.

## Process and quality

Our approach is to integrate the material into your process, not just to deliver a product.

Key steps:

- **Initial assessment.** We collect data on alloys, equipment, process parameters and typical defects, as well as any HSE or logistics constraints.
- **Material selection.** We propose binders, coatings and auxiliaries for your processes and casting requirements and discuss options for recipes and consumption levels.
- **Trials and ramp-up.** We support shop floor trials, help select operating windows and document stable settings.
- **Training and support.** We train operators, provide clear application guidelines and process control recommendations.
- **Ongoing support.** We stay in touch on all process-related issues and, when needed, visit the site to help solve non-standard situations.

## Geography

We supply foundries across Russia and neighbouring countries. Our logistics are planned to deliver materials on time and in the required quantities, taking into account:

- seasonal changes in production load;
- planned shutdowns and maintenance;
- stock level requirements and product shelf life.

The goal is simple: no downtime because the foundry has run out of binders, coatings or auxiliaries.

## Intema Group in numbers

Our product range is built around real foundry needs:

- **3 main product lines:** binder systems, coatings and auxiliary materials.
- **10+ casting processes** we support: alpha-set, furan, cold-box, croning, lost foam, no-bake, permanent mould, sodium silicate, resol-CO₂, Pep-set and others.
- **2 coating bases:** water-based and alcohol-based.
- **5 main fillers:** zircon, graphite, magnesite, aluminosilicate, chromite.
- **8 types of auxiliaries:** AIPS (alcohol for coatings), adhesives, modifiers, cleaning and release agents, repair pastes, sealing cords, exothermic products.

The catalogue and filters are structured so that engineers can quickly find relevant materials for a given process, alloy and casting requirement.

## Certificates and documentation

Key products are supported by technical data sheets and quality certificates. On request we provide all documents required by your quality and procurement teams.

Up-to-date certificates and documentation are available in the [“Documents & certificates”](/en/documents) section. If needed, we can prepare an individual documentation set for tender procedures or specific customer requirements.
