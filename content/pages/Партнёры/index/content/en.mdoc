## Shengquan Group (SQ Group) – Intema Group’s strategic partner

Shengquan Group is a Chinese high-tech group of companies founded in 1979. Today it is one of the global leaders in phenolic and furan resins as well as advanced solutions for foundry production. The group combines several business segments – foundry materials, high-performance phenolic resins, phenolic foams and bio / fine chemicals – and supplies its products to more than 50 countries worldwide.

In the foundry field, SQ Group holds leading positions in terms of production volumes: annual phenolic resin capacity is around 650,000 tonnes and furan binders around 150,000 tonnes, which places the company at the top of the global market for these products. Its portfolio for foundries includes furan resins, cold-box systems, alkaline phenolic binders, coatings for moulds and cores, ceramic filters, exothermic and insulating sleeves, as well as solutions for emission reduction and flue-gas treatment.

For Intema Group, Shengquan is a key technology and raw-material partner. We bring SQ binders and coatings to the Russian market and adapt them to specific processes (furan, Resol-CO₂, cold- and warm-box, etc.), alloys and equipment. The combination of SQ’s global R&D capabilities and Intema’s practical foundry experience gives our customers stable sand-mixture properties and predictable results on the shop floor – from reduced burn-on to lower scrap and more consistent casting geometry.

### What our customers gain from the SQ partnership

- Direct access to world-class phenolic and furan resin technologies without extra intermediaries.
- A broad range of systems for different processes: from classical furan binders to low-emission cold-box and alkaline phenolic solutions.
- Support for launching new lines and switching to more environmentally friendly recipes (joint trials, on-site visits, process tuning).
- Long-term stability of supply and product specifications, which is critical for serial production.

## Cavenaghi S.p.A. – European partner for foundry systems

Cavenaghi S.p.A. is an Italian company that has been operating since 1959 on the Italian and international markets. It focuses on the research, development, production and commercialization of agglomerating systems and additives for foundries, as well as industrial resins and auxiliary chemicals for related industries. The Cavenaghi plant in Lainate, near Milan, supplies foundry products that are widely regarded as a benchmark for reliability and quality.

In the foundry segment, Cavenaghi offers a full set of binders: no-bake systems, several cold-box technologies (including low-VOC solutions), epoxy-acrylic systems with SO₂, phenolic-urethane and polyol systems for aluminium and steel castings, plus coatings for cores and moulds. A strong focus is placed on environmental performance: reducing smoke and odour, lowering emissions and improving working conditions in the foundry.

Through Intema Group, Russian foundries can access these European technologies. For us, Cavenaghi is a partner for demanding projects: complex castings, tight dimensional tolerances, strict environmental requirements or international customer audits. We can bring in Cavenaghi systems when standard binders do not provide the required combination of sand-mixture properties, mechanical strength and ecological performance.

## Why we choose partners like these

- A clear focus on the foundry industry rather than “general” industrial chemistry.
- Strong R&D centres that regularly introduce new binders, coatings and filter technologies.
- Broad product portfolios that allow us to tailor solutions to a specific alloy, process and piece of equipment instead of forcing the plant to adapt to the chemistry.
- High quality and environmental standards, confirmed by international certifications and cooperation with leading automotive and engineering companies.
- Openness to technical dialogue: together with SQ and Cavenaghi engineers we can fine-tune recipes and process parameters for the needs of Russian foundries.

## Open to new partnerships

Intema Group remains open to cooperation with manufacturers of foundry materials, engineering companies and distributors who share our views on quality and technical support.

If you see potential for joint work – whether to extend the product range or to deliver integrated solutions for foundries – please contact us at **zakaz@intema.ru**. We will get back to you and offer a clear, transparent partnership format.
