# Materials and solutions for foundry production

## What we do

Intema Group supplies materials for foundry shops: binder systems, release coatings, and auxiliary products. We help foundries stabilise moulding and core-making processes, reduce scrap, and keep production predictable.

We work with manual and automated moulding lines, small and large batches, and support both technologists and production managers when they introduce new materials without stopping the line.

## What we supply

- **Binder systems**\
  — solutions for alpha-set, furan and other no-bake processes;\
  — consistent strength of moulds and cores;\
  — predictable behaviour of the sand mix during storage and pouring.
- **Release coatings**\
  — alcohol- and water-based coatings with different fillers;\
  — protection against burn-on and improved casting surface quality;\
  — tuning of the formulation for your alloy and process.
- **Auxiliary materials**\
  — die release agents;\
  — adhesives, repair pastes, sealing cords;\
  — exothermic and insulating sleeves, modifiers and other products that keep the foundry running stably.

## How we work with foundries

We do more than ship materials — we support their implementation on site.

1. Analyse the current process and issues: scrap, instability, new requirements to castings.
1. Select binders, coatings and auxiliary products for your alloy, equipment and process window.
1. Run joint trials at your foundry, document the parameters and results.
1. Train the team to work with the new materials and follow the recommended process discipline.
1. Stay in touch and help when you scale up or change your product mix.
