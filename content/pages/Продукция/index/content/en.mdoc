# Intema Group products

Intema Group supplies binder systems, foundry coatings, and auxiliary materials for metal casting. We help with core and mould mixes, casting surface quality, and keeping the process stable.

## Binder systems

- **Processes:** cold-box (amine / CO₂), alpha-set, furan and resol systems, pep-set, and liquid-sodium-silicate processes.
- **Benefits:** consistent strength of cores and moulds, predictable shake-out, lower scrap from gas and mechanical defects.
- **Where they fit:** for new lines and for replacing existing systems with minimal process changes.

## Foundry coatings

- **Types:** alcohol and water-based coatings with zircon, aluminosilicate, graphite, magnesite, or chromite fillers.
- **Benefits:** clean casting surfaces, fewer burn-on defects, less manual grinding.
- **Where used:** large and critical castings, non-ferrous casting, and areas with higher surface requirements.

## Auxiliary materials

- **For tooling:** release agents for patterns and mould boxes, sealing cords, repair pastes.
- **For melting and pouring:** exothermic and covering compounds, modifiers for ductile and grey iron, additives that stabilise the process.
- **For maintenance:** cleaning agents and service materials to keep equipment running consistently.
