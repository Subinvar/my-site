# Intema Group products

Intema Group supplies materials for foundries running cold-box, alpha-set, furan, resol and other no-bake processes as well as traditional green sand moulding. Our range covers core and mould production, tooling protection and stabilising the quality of castings.

## Binder systems

- **Processes:** cold-box (amine / CO₂), alpha-set, furan and resol no-bake systems, pep-set, liquid-sodium-silicate based processes.
- **Benefits:** consistent core and mould strengths, predictable shake-out, reduced gas-related defects and burn-on, and the ability to adapt the binder package to your sand, equipment and casting requirements.

## Release and facing coatings

- **Types:** alcohol-based and water-based coatings with zircon, aluminosilicate, graphite, magnesite or chromite fillers.
- **Typical use cases:** large and critical castings, iron and steel castings, complex tooling and thin-walled areas where surface finish and easy cleaning are crucial.

## Auxiliary materials

- **For tooling:** release agents for patterns and moulding boxes, sealing cords, repair pastes.
- **For melting and pouring:** exothermic and covering compounds, modifiers for ductile and grey iron, additives to stabilise the melting and pouring process.
- **For maintenance:** cleaning agents and service materials to keep equipment in stable operation and reduce downtime.
