## Usage

Add resin to sand after introducing the catalyst. Typical dosage: 1.2–1.5% resin by sand weight, and 15–25% catalyst by resin weight. Molding temperature: +15 to +30 °C. Suitable for fresh and reclaimed sand.

## Packaging and storage

Supplied in drums (240 kg) and IBCs (1000–1250 kg). Store at +5 to +30 °C in sealed containers away from heat sources. Shelf life: 6 months.
