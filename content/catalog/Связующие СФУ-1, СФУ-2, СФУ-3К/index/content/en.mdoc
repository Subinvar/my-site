# SFU

{% product-header %}
### Application

Three-component phenolic urethane no-bake binder system (SFU-1, SFU-2 and SFU-3K catalyst) for the Pep-set process. Designed for moulds and cores based on sand mixes for cast iron, steel and non-ferrous castings, including large and complex shapes.

## Key features and benefits

- **High early strength.** Tensile strength of at least 2.0 MPa after 1 h, 2.2 MPa after 3 h and 2.4 MPa after 24 h — moulds and cores withstand handling and pouring loads.
- **Controlled curing.** Bench life of 5–6 minutes at 20–25 °C with the option to accelerate or slow down curing by adjusting SFU-3K dosage — easy to match different mould sizes and production rates.
- **Low gas evolution and fewer defects.** Curing proceeds without water formation; for particularly gas-sensitive castings the SFU-1 level can be reduced and 1–4 % Fe₃O₄ can be added to the sand mix.
- **One system for different alloys.** Suitable for cast iron, steel (including austenitic grades) and non-ferrous alloys; works well with fresh quartz sand and reclaimed sand.
- **Easy implementation.** Standard recipe with equal parts of SFU-1 and SFU-2 and compatibility with conventional no-bake mixers simplify process start-up.

## Typical properties

### System composition

- **SFU-1** — phenolic urethane resin in organic solvent.  
- **SFU-2** — isocyanate resin based on methyl di-isocyanate.  
- **SFU-3K** — amine catalyst based on pyridine.

## Use and recommendations

**Standard sand mix.**  
100 parts by weight of quartz sand AFS 50–55, 0.5–0.6 parts of SFU-1, 0.5–0.6 parts of SFU-2 and SFU-3K catalyst when required.

**Mixing procedure.**  
Load sand into the mixer, add SFU-1 and mix for about 60 seconds. Then add SFU-2 and continue mixing for another 60 seconds. For low sand temperatures, add SFU-3K to SFU-1 or dose it directly into the sand mix at 1–3 % of the SFU-1 amount before moulding.

**Application areas.**  
The system is intended for moulds and cores for all types of cast iron, steel and non-ferrous castings — from small serial parts to large, complex castings. For austenitic steels, 1–4 % of Fe₃O₄ (magnetite) in the sand mix is recommended to further reduce gas-related defects.

## Packaging and storage

All SFU components are supplied in clean, dry steel drums in accordance with relevant standards, with a net mass of up to 220 kg. Other tight containers ensuring product integrity during transport and storage are also allowed.

Store components at +10…+25 °C in tightly closed containers, protected from atmospheric moisture and direct sunlight. The guaranteed shelf life of SFU-1 and SFU-2 is 6 months from the date of manufacture under proper storage conditions. In case of freezing, allow the product to warm up in a heated room (not exceeding 25 °C) until fully thawed; forced heating is not permitted.
