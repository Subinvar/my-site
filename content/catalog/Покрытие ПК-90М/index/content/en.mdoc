# PK-90M

{% callout title="Brief" %}
Alcohol-based magnesite foundry coating for manganese and high-temperature steels; withstands extreme thermal loads and delivers a clean casting surface.
{% /callout %}

## Description

PK-90M is an alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating with magnesite as the main refractory filler and increased refractoriness. When applied to moulds and cores it forms a strong insulating layer that withstands prolonged exposure to the high pouring temperatures of manganese and alloy steels. The reddish colour of the dried film makes it easy to distinguish from zircon and graphite coatings and to visually control coverage.

## Application

PK-90M is recommended for casting high-manganese steels and other alloy steels with elevated pouring temperatures where standard zircon coatings operate at their limits. It is ideal for heavy hot spots, massive steel sections, areas under risers and other critical regions of the mould or core. The product can be used in no-bake, sodium silicate and green sand processes.

## Key properties

- **Type.** Fast-drying alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating.
- **Main filler.** Magnesite.
- **Coating colour.** Reddish / light red.
- **Recommended alloys.** Manganese steel and other alloy steels; can also be used for cast iron and non-ferrous alloys with very high thermal loads.
- **Moulding processes.** No-bake, sodium silicate, green sand.
- **Application methods.** Brushing, dipping, spraying; suitable for both thin and reinforced cover layers.

## Benefits

- High refractoriness for extreme pouring temperatures of manganese and alloy steels.
- Stable burn-on protection in the hottest parts of the mould and core.
- Reduction of surface defects such as burn-on, surface cracking and rough skin.
- Less grinding and cleaning of castings, reduced load on fettling operations.
