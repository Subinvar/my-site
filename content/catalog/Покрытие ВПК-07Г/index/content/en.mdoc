## Application
Water-dilutable graphite anti-penetration coating for sand moulds and cores in iron casting. It creates a lubricating graphite film that reduces burn-on and facilitates surface cleaning and machining.

## Key benefits
- Tailored for iron castings, protecting hot areas of the mould from burn-on and metal penetration.
- Graphite filler makes shake-out and grinding easier, reducing fettling time.
- Performs reliably on green-sand, sodium-silicate and no-bake systems, providing a uniform coating layer.
- High suspension stability allows convenient direct use from standard containers.
- Water-based system simplifies compliance with occupational safety and fire protection requirements.

## Typical use
Recommended for grey and ductile iron castings in serial and mass production — housings, flywheels, drivetrain components and other standard cast parts. The product is mixed and adjusted with water to working viscosity and applied by brushing, spraying or dipping.
