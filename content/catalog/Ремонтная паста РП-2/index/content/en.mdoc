## Application
RP-2 repair paste is a ready-to-use red-brown paste for eliminating surface defects of cores and molds (seams, cracks, chips, blowholes) and sealing areas where molten metal may run into mold joints. It is used on molding lines for ferrous and non-ferrous castings.

## Key benefits
- High tack and plasticity ensure good wetting of the sand surface and filling of fine pores.
- Forms a strong, heat-resistant layer that withstands molten metal.
- Low gas generation, so it does not cause porosity or gas defects in the casting.
- Supplied ready to use — no mixing with hardeners or binders required.
- Improves dimensional accuracy and surface finish of castings, reducing subsequent machining.

## How to use
Apply the paste onto a clean, dry surface in the defect area. Press it into pores and cracks with a spatula or gloved fingers to shape the required contour. Allow the repaired area to cure. RP-2 is suitable for filling cracks and chips on cores, repairing seams and surface defects on molds, and locally sealing mold joints where metal run-out is possible.

## Main technical data
- Appearance: red-brown paste.
- Density at 20 °C: 1.3–1.8 g/cm³.
- Composition: heat-resistant mineral filler (aluminosilicates) + sodium-silicate-based binder.

## Packaging and storage
Packed in 0.5 kg plastic tubes placed in cardboard boxes with a total weight of about 20 kg. Store in unopened original packaging in a dry warehouse. When stored as recommended, the paste maintains its properties for the guaranteed shelf life.
