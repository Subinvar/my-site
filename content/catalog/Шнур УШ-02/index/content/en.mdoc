# USH-02

{% callout title="Brief" %}
- Sealing cord for sand-mold parting lines
- Elastic structure conforms to the gap
- Diameter range 4–24 mm
{% /callout %}

## Application
USH-02 is a sealing cord made of mineral fillers and organic components containing aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is designed to seal mold joints and prevent molten metal from escaping through gaps and core vents.

## Key benefits
- Reliably seals flask joints and mold parting lines, reducing run-outs and metal fins.
- Deformable, elastic structure fills the gap tightly and follows the mold geometry.
- Wide diameter range: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24 mm — easy to choose the right size.
- Supplied in convenient coils; easy to cut to the required length on site.
- Lowers scrap risk and accidental leakage, reducing post-casting rework.

## How to use
Place the cord into mold joints or flask parting lines before filling or assembling the mold, pressing it gently along the length for close contact. Use on any sand mold, especially in zones with high load or a risk of metal run-out through gaps or vents.

## Main technical data
- Product type: deformable sealing cord.
- Nominal diameters: 4–24 mm (standard range).
- Base: mineral fillers + organic components (aliphatic hydrocarbons).

## Packaging and storage
The cord is wound into coils weighing from 1.0 to 3.5 kg, depending on diameter. Store in the manufacturer’s closed packaging at 15–25 °C in a dry, ventilated area away from heat sources and open flames. Guaranteed shelf life is 12 months under specified conditions.
