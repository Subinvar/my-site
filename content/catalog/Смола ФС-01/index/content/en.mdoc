# FS-01

### Application

Premium alkaline phenol-formaldehyde resin for the Alphaset cold-setting process. Intended for moulds and cores based on cold-setting sand mixes, especially where high reclaimed-sand ratios and increased strength requirements are critical.

## Key features and benefits

- Higher mould and core strength compared to standard Alphaset resins.
- Reliable performance with high shares of thermally reclaimed sand without loss of casting quality.
- Low gas evolution and reduced odour due to decreased free phenol and formaldehyde content.
- Suitable for both cores and moulds, including flaskless moulding.
- Fully compatible with all A-series hardeners – easy to adjust bench life to the size and complexity of the mould.

## Use and recommendations

FS-01 is recommended for lines with intensive use of thermally reclaimed sand and for critical cores and moulds. Typical dosage: about 1.2–1.6 % resin on sand (depending on reclaimed sand share) and 20–25 % A-series hardener on resin. Add the hardener to sand first, mix thoroughly, then introduce the resin and continue mixing until a homogeneous mixture is obtained.

FS-01 is particularly effective for steel and high-strength iron castings of complex geometry and medium to large mass, where high mould strength and resistance to mechanical loads during assembly and pouring are required.

## Packaging and storage

Supplied in steel drums and IBC containers (see TDS/specification for exact packaging and weights). Store in tightly closed containers at the temperature range specified in the TDS (typically +5…+25–30 °C), protected from direct sunlight. Avoid freezing and prolonged overheating. Before use after long storage, mix the contents until homogeneous. Shelf life – according to the current specification.
