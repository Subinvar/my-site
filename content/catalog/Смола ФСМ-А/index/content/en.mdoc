# FSM-A

### Application

Modified low-emission alkaline phenolic resin for the Alphaset process. Used for moulds and cores in steel, high-strength iron and non-ferrous foundries where minimal odour and improved working conditions in the moulding shop are critical.

## Key features and benefits

- Reduced phenol and formaldehyde emissions – very low odour during moulding and pouring.
- No nitrogen- or phosphorus-bearing components in the binder – lower risk of gas-related defects linked to N and P.
- High mould and core strength comparable to premium FS-series resins.
- Clean burnout – reduced burn-on and improved casting surface finish.
- Fully compatible with all A-series hardeners and standard sand-mixing equipment.

## Use and recommendations

FSM-A is recommended for foundries focused on environmental performance and improved working conditions. It is suitable for cores and moulds for critical steel and iron castings, including large and complex shapes.

Typical dosage: about 1.2–1.6 % resin on sand and 20–25 % A-series hardener on resin. To extend bench life, slower grades such as A-20, A-30 or A-60 can be used. Normal ventilation of the moulding and pouring areas is recommended, as with any organic binder system.

## Packaging and storage

Supplied in standard industrial packaging (steel drums, IBC containers – see TDS/specification). Store in a dry, well-ventilated area at the temperature range specified in the specification (typically +5…+25–30 °C), in tightly closed containers away from heat and open flame. Protect from freezing. Before use after long storage, mix contents until homogeneous.
