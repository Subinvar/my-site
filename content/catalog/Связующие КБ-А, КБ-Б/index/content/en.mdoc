# KB-A-B

{% product-header %}
### Application
KB-A / KB-B is a two-component phenolic binder system for the Cold-Box-amin process used for cores and small/medium moulds in steel, iron and non-ferrous casting.

## Key features and benefits

- **Stable strength profile.** High tensile strength immediately after gassing and after curing (up to ~1.6 MPa after 24 h under standard conditions).
- **High productivity.** Fast through-cure of the core section enables short core-making cycles on high-speed machines.
- **Good sand flowability.** Provides dense filling of complex core boxes and stable core geometry.
- **Wide sand compatibility.** Suitable for silica, zircon, chromite and dunitic/disten-sillimanite sands with moisture up to 0.2 %.
- **Balanced environmental performance.** Low free formaldehyde content in the resin component while maintaining strength and bench life of the mix.

## Use and recommendations

- **Mix design.** Silica or special sands with moisture ≤0.2 %. Total binder addition 0.4–0.8 % of sand weight, KB-A and KB-B dosed in approximately equal parts.
- **Mixing sequence.** Charge sand into the mixer, add KB-A and mix for ~60 s, then add KB-B and mix for another ~60 s until a homogeneous core sand is obtained.
- **Curing.** Blow the mix with tertiary amine-based gas (KB-K catalyst) at approx. 0.20–0.28 MPa for 5–20 s depending on core size, then purge with clean air to remove residual amine.
- **Applications.** High-precision iron and steel castings in serial and mass production: automotive, power engineering and general engineering cores.

## Recommended catalyst

- [KB-K catalyst](/catalog/kb-k)

## Packaging and storage

- **Packaging.** Both components are supplied in steel drums with net weight up to 220 kg, filled to not more than 98 % of volume.
- **Storage.** Store in tightly closed drums in a covered, ventilated warehouse, protected from moisture and direct sunlight, in accordance with general industrial safety and environmental regulations.
