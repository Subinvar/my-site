## Key features and benefits
- High shell strength – ensures dimensional accuracy and mold stability.
- Fast thermal curing – ideal for high-throughput production lines.
- Low free phenol content – reduced odor and emissions during molding.
- Easy knock-out – simplifies casting cleanup.
- Versatile use – suitable for various metal alloys.

## Typical properties

| Property                   | Value            | Note/conditions               |
|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Binder type               | Phenol-formaldehyde resin | —                     |
| Appearance                | 3–10 mm granules | Light brown                   |
| Flow length               | 40–65 mm         | GOST method                   |
| Free phenol content       | ≤ 1.5 %          | —                             |
| Softening point           | 95–110 °C        | —                             |

## Use and recommendations
Quartz sand is mixed with SK-92 (4–5 %) and hexamine (8–12 % of binder). The mix is poured onto a heated pattern (200–300 °C), forming a 6–20 mm shell. Shell halves are removed and oven-cured up to 400 °C, then bonded. Suitable for accurate, smooth-surfaced castings in mass production.

## Packaging and storage
Packed in 25 or 40 kg bags. Store in a dry area at 0–25 °C. Shelf life – 12 months.
