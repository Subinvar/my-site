# QHJ-3 — high-magnesium nodulariser for severe treatment conditions

{% callout title="Brief" %}
High-magnesium nodulariser for demanding conditions: higher sulphur, heavy sections and lower metal temperatures. Ensures high nodularity and strength of ductile iron castings.
{% /callout %}

QHJ-3 is a nodulariser with higher magnesium content than QHJ-1 and QHJ-2. It is designed for situations requiring “strong” treatment: base iron with elevated sulphur, reduced pouring temperatures or heavy-section castings where deep and stable nodularisation is needed.

## Application range

- Ductile iron production from base irons with higher sulphur levels.
- Heavy-section and large castings demanding reliable nodularity across the section.
- Casting conditions with limited tapping or pouring temperatures where additional Mg activity is required.

## Key benefits

- High magnesium activity providing required residual Mg even under unfavourable conditions.
- Reliable spheroidal graphite formation in massive sections.
- Combined additions of Mg, rare earths and calcium refine inclusions and stabilise the microstructure.
- Ability to compensate for higher sulphur or lower temperature without excessive alloy consumption.

## Use recommendations

- Requires careful process control: sufficient alloy cover, correct treatment depth and temperature monitoring.
- Addition rate and processing parameters must follow the TU; for high-sulphur irons the reactive nature of QHJ-3 should be taken into account.
- Adequate fume extraction and operator protection are recommended.

## Packaging, storage and safety

QHJ-3 is supplied as standard granules (5–20 / 10–25 mm) in industrial packaging. Store dry and away from moisture or reactive substances. Use proper PPE and follow standard rules for handling magnesium-bearing alloys. Full details are given in the TU and Technical Description.
