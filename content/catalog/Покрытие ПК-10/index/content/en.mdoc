{% callout title="Brief" %}
Alcohol-based graphite–forsterite foundry coating for small and medium cast iron and non-ferrous castings; provides a smooth surface with economical consumption.
{% /callout %}

## Description

PK-10 is an alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating with a combined filler system of graphite and forsterite. Graphite provides a smooth, low-friction mould surface, while forsterite ensures thermal resistance and good heat capacity of the layer. The grey colour of the dried coating helps visually control layer thickness and uniformity.

## Application

PK-10 is designed for small and medium cast iron castings (grey and ductile iron) and for a range of non-ferrous alloys where a balance between surface quality and process cost is required. It is especially suitable for thin-walled castings, housings and general engineering parts. The product can be used in no-bake, sodium silicate and green sand processes based on quartz sand.

## Key properties

- **Type.** Fast-drying alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating.
- **Main fillers.** Graphite and forsterite.
- **Coating colour.** Grey.
- **Recommended alloys.** Cast iron (small and medium castings), selected non-ferrous alloys.
- **Moulding processes.** No-bake, sodium silicate, green sand.
- **Application methods.** Brushing, dipping, spraying; easy to apply as a thin, uniform film.

## Benefits

- Good surface finish at a moderate coating cost.
- Smooth, uniform layer that reduces burn-on risk and simplifies shakeout.
- Economical consumption thanks to high hiding power and thin-layer application.
- Suitable for a wide range of standard cast iron and non-ferrous parts.
