## Application
Water-dilutable zircon anti-penetration coating for sand moulds and cores used in carbon-steel casting. It provides high refractoriness and strong resistance to metal penetration in thermally stressed areas.

## Key benefits
- Zircon filler effectively protects steel mould surfaces from burn-on, erosion and hot-tear related defects.
- High sedimentation stability and dense barrier layer deliver consistent results from batch to batch.
- Compatible with green-sand, sodium-silicate and no-bake processes, including high steel-pouring temperatures and long holding times.
- Water-based system reduces safety risks and operating costs compared with alcohol-based coatings.

## Typical use
Recommended for carbon and low-alloy steel castings with increased requirements to surface quality and defect prevention — housings, flanges, power-engineering and oil-and-gas components. Applied to mould and core areas exposed to high thermal load. The coating is mixed, adjusted with water to the specified working density and applied by brushing, spraying or dipping.
