# FS-03

### Application

Alkaline phenol-formaldehyde resin for the Alphaset cold-setting process. Designed for moulds and cores based on cold-setting sand mixtures in steel and iron foundries.

## Key features and benefits

- Universal grade for most medium-sized steel and iron castings.
- Stable mould and core strength at standard resin addition levels.
- Low free phenol and formaldehyde content – controlled gas evolution and acceptable working environment.
- Good shake-out behaviour after pouring, easier cleaning of castings.
- Fully compatible with all A-series hardeners – easy to adjust bench life.

## Typical properties (typical values)

| Property                         | Value                 | Remarks                            |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Appearance                       | Mobile liquid, light yellow to dark red | Homogeneous, no visible inclusions |
| Viscosity (20 °C, Ø4 mm cup)     | ≤ 75 s                | VZ-246 cup                         |
| pH (20 °C)                       | 11–15                 | Alkaline                           |
| Free phenol                      | ≤ 0.5 %               |                                    |
| Free formaldehyde               | ≤ 0.1 %               | Reduced odour                      |
| Recommended resin addition       | ~1.0–1.5 % on sand    | Depends on sand quality            |

## Use and recommendations

Add the A-series hardener to sand first, mix for 2–3 minutes, then introduce the resin and continue mixing until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. Typical dosage: 1.1–1.5 % resin on sand and 20–25 % hardener on resin. At 20 °C the bench life with A-10 is about 4–5 minutes, with strip time around 15 minutes. Fresh quartz sand is preferred; thermally reclaimed sand can also be used, with resin dosage adjusted as required.

## Packaging and storage

Supplied in steel drums of approx. 240 kg and IBC containers of about 1100–1250 kg. Store in tightly closed containers at +5…+30 °C, away from direct sunlight. Protect from freezing and prolonged overheating. Before use after long storage, mix the contents of the container until homogeneous. Shelf life: 6 months from production date.
