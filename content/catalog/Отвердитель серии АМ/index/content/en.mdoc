{% callout title="Brief" %}
- Category: Связующие
- Processes: ЖСС
- Bench life control from 1 to 60 minutes — suitable for any core or mold size and sand temperature.
{% /callout %}

## Application

The AM series acid hardeners are used in waterglass (CO2-cured) molding and coremaking. They adjust the mixture's bench life depending on casting geometry and production conditions.

## Key features and benefits

- Full product range for different bench life: from 1 to 60 minutes.
- Easy selection based on sand temperature and casting size.
- Compatible with new and reclaimed sands.
- Works with all typical waterglass formulations, including additives.
- Economical dosage and stable casting quality.

## Typical properties

| Property | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Acid hardener | — |
| Total acid content | 20–50 % | Varies by grade |
| Viscosity (20 °C) | 10–30 mPa·s | Based on TDS data |
| Density (20 °C) | 1.20–1.35 g/cm³ | See datasheet |
| Recommended addition | 30–70 % of binder mass | Depends on production needs |
| Sand temperature range | 5 to 40 °C | Suitable for all seasons |
| Shelf life | Up to 12 months | In sealed container |

## Use and recommendations

Add the hardener to the sand mixture after or simultaneously with the sodium silicate binder. The higher the AM number (AM-10, AM-60), the longer the bench life. Select the grade based on ambient temperature, sand condition, and core/mold complexity. Suitable for cold- or warm-box conditions, small to medium castings.

## Packaging and storage

Available in 20 kg cans, 240 kg drums, or 1000 kg IBCs. Store in a dry, cool place at +5 °C to +35 °C. Do not freeze or overheat. Stir before use.
