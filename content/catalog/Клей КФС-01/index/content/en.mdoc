## Application
KFS-01 is a ready-to-use light brown / beige adhesive paste for bonding and repairing sand molds and cores across different binder systems. It delivers a strong, heat-resistant joint between mold elements during metal pouring.

## Key benefits
- Excellent adhesion to sand mixtures based on sodium silicate and organic binders.
- Heat-resistant mineral filler keeps the joint stable at pouring temperature.
- Supplied ready mixed — no extra preparation or mixing required.
- Low gas evolution, so casting surface quality is not impaired.
- Convenient drop or bead application from a tube with minimal overuse.

## How to use
Apply KFS-01 in drops or a thin continuous bead onto one bonding surface along the contact area. Position the second part, press firmly together and allow the adhesive to cure. Surfaces should be dry and free of dust. KFS-01 is suitable for primary bonding as well as quick on-line repair of chips and cracks on the molding line.
