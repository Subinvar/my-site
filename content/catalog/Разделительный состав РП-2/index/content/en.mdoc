## Application
Release coating for no-bake moulds and cores based on cold-setting sand mixtures. Provides a stable, low-friction film at the pattern surface, reducing adhesion of the sand mix and protecting tooling in serial production.

## Key benefits
- Good thixotropy and flow, forming an even thin layer without runs or drips.
- High anti-friction effect, lowering the stripping force of moulds and cores.
- Low gas evolution, helping to minimise porosity and gas-related defects.
- Does not foul the pattern equipment; easier maintenance and longer service life.
- Stable performance in high-throughput no-bake lines.

## Typical use
- Wooden, plastic or metal patterns and core boxes used with organic no-bake binders.
- Moulding lines for medium and large castings where multiple strips are made from one pattern.
- Applications requiring controlled release and improved surface quality of castings.

## Directions for use
Stir or shake well before use to restore homogeneity. Apply onto clean pattern or core box surfaces by brush or spray, forming a thin, uniform film. Allow the solvent to evaporate; several moulds or cores can usually be produced from one application until the release effect decreases and re-coating is required.

## Typical features (short)
- Process type: no-bake moulds and cores.
- Formulated for use with common organic binder systems.
- Shelf life: typically up to 6 months in closed original containers.

## Packaging and storage
Supplied in 20 kg plastic cans. Store in tightly closed containers, in a cool and well-ventilated area, away from heat and ignition sources. Mix before use after prolonged storage.
