# FS-06CO₂

{% product-header %}

### Application

FS-06CO₂ is a cold-setting phenolic resol resin for sand cores and moulding with CO₂ gas curing. Delivers fast strength development, minimal gas emission, and reliable performance on reclaimed sand for iron and steel casting production.

## Key features and benefits

- Fast and stable curing under CO₂ flow without acidic hardeners.
- Low gas evolution and reduced residual formaldehyde — cleaner castings.
- High mechanical strength and easy knock-out even on reclaimed sand.
- Simplified process: no liquid hardeners, fewer dosage tolerances.

## Typical properties

| Property | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Viscosity (20 °C) | 150–350 mPa·s | Brookfield, spindle #3 |
| Density (20 °C) | 1.15–1.25 g/cm³ | GOST 18995.1–73 |
| pH | 6.5–8.5 | 10% aqueous solution |
| Free phenol | ≤ 1.0 % |  |
| Free formaldehyde | ≤ 1.0 % |  |
| Bench life | 15–30 min | At 1% sand moisture |
| Recommended addition | 1.0–1.2 % | Of sand weight |

## Use and recommendations

Add FS-06CO₂ resin to sand at 1.0–1.2% by weight. Mix thoroughly, then cure the shape by CO₂ gas blowing. Best suited for medium to large castings requiring ecological compliance and reclaimed sand compatibility. Optimal sand moisture: 0.3–0.5%.

## Packaging and storage

- Available in 240 kg drums or 1000 kg IBC containers.
- Store in sealed containers at +5 °C to +25 °C. Avoid overheating and freezing.
- Shelf life: 6 months.
