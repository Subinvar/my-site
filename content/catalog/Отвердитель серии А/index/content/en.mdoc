# A-series hardeners

### Application

A-series ester hardeners are designed for curing alkaline phenolic resins in the Alphaset process. They are used in cold-setting sand mixes for making moulds and cores from quartz and reclaimed sands.

## Key features and benefits

- Wide bench-life range – from a few minutes up to nearly one hour by selecting grades from A-2 to A-60.
- Universal use with all FS-series and other alkaline phenolic resins.
- Operation at shop temperature, without additional heating or cooling.
- No nitrogen- or sulphur-based acids – reduced gas defects and lower corrosion on equipment compared to acid systems.
- Simple dosing and mixing in standard cold-setting sand mixers.

|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Product type                      | Ester hardener         | for alkaline phenolic resins        |
| Appearance                        | Light-coloured liquid  | homogeneous                         |
| Recommended addition              | 20–25 % on resin       | for all A-series grades             |
| Operating temperature             | <!-- range from spec --> | shop temperature                   |
| Bench life range (indicative)     | approx. 1–40 minutes   | depending on grade and conditions   |

*For exact values of each grade (A-2, A-5, A-10, A-20, A-30, A-60), refer to the current TDS and specification.*

## Use and recommendations

A-series hardeners are added to sand before the resin. Typical procedure:

1. Dose the required quantity of A-series hardener into the mixer and mix with sand.
2. After uniform distribution of the hardener, add the resin and continue mixing until a homogeneous mix is obtained.
3. Select the hardener grade according to the required bench life and operating conditions:

- **A-2, A-5** – for small cores, fast-cycle production and lower sand temperatures.
- **A-10** – general-purpose grade for most moulds and cores.
- **A-20, A-30** – for medium and large moulds where extended time for ramming and assembly is needed.
- **A-60** – for very large moulds and complex core assemblies, providing maximum bench life.

Process trials are recommended when changing hardener grade or when sand temperature varies significantly.

## Packaging and storage

Supplied in steel drums and IBC containers (see TDS/specification for details). Store in tightly closed containers at the temperature range specified in the specification, protected from moisture, direct sunlight and sources of heat. Avoid prolonged contact with water, as partial decomposition may occur. When stored under recommended conditions, A-series hardeners retain their specified properties throughout the stated shelf life.
