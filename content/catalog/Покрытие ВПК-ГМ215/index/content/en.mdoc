## Application
Water-dilutable anti-penetration coating with zircon filler for moulds and cores in carbon steel and iron casting. Intended for areas with extreme thermal load and strict surface-quality requirements, such as hot spots, riser surroundings and sealing surfaces.

## Key benefits
- Zircon refractory provides excellent resistance to metal penetration, erosion and thermal shock during long pouring times.
- Forms a dense, robust barrier layer that reduces machining allowances and finishing operations.
- High suspension stability and good flow make the product suitable for both dipping and spraying applications with consistent layer thickness.
- Water-based formulation improves fire safety and simplifies plant layout compared with alcohol-based coatings.
- Compatible with no-bake, sodium-silicate, green-sand moulds and cores, as well as EPS patterns for lost-foam casting.

## Typical use
Recommended for steel and iron castings in power engineering, heavy-duty machinery and other demanding applications, where stable protection on thermally loaded surfaces is critical. Applied to cores and mould cavities exposed to high metal temperature and long pouring times. The product is thoroughly mixed before use, then adjusted with water to the target working density and applied by brushing, spraying or dipping.
