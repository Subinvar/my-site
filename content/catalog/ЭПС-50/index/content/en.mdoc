# EPS-50 — high-performance exothermic cover mix for demanding steel castings

{% callout title="Brief" %}
High-performance exothermic cover mix for steel feeders. Recommended for heavy-section castings and critical steel parts requiring extended feeding.
{% /callout %}

EPS-50 is an exothermic cover powder for open steel feeders and ingots, engineered for casting conditions where extended feeding time and high thermal performance are critical. The mix forms a robust insulating layer and delivers strong exothermic heating of the feeder, making it particularly suitable for heavy-section castings and critical steel components.

## Application range

- Carbon, low-alloy and high-alloy steels, including heat-resistant and structural grades.
- Large castings and ingots, heavy sections and hot spots.
- Casting layouts with a high risk of shrinkage cavities and macro-porosity where standard cover mixes are not sufficient.

## Key benefits

- Enhanced exothermic effect: intensive heating of the feeder and prolonged liquid phase in the feeding zone.
- Excellent insulating behaviour, reducing heat losses through the feeder surface.
- Lower shrinkage defects and improved reliability of heavy sections.
- Optimised particle size distribution for stable coverage and minimal erosion during pouring.
- Potential to reduce feeder size while maintaining safe feeding conditions, saving metal.

## Use recommendations

- Add EPS-50 onto the open metal surface immediately after the mould or ingot is filled, spreading it evenly over the feeder area.
- Select the layer thickness and addition rate according to feeder dimensions and the product TU/technological instruction.
- Can be combined with exothermic or insulating sleeves for maximum effect.

## Packaging, storage and safety

Supplied in standard industrial packaging. Store in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area away from ignition sources. Use appropriate PPE (gloves, goggles, respirator) when handling. For detailed product parameters and safety requirements, refer to the TU and Technical Description of EPS-50.
