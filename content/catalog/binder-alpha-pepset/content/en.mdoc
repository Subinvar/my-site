## Benefits

- Fast strength build-up at ambient temperature.
- Lower gas evolution thanks to the optimised catalyst package.
- Easy to meter on automated sand mixers.

## Application

1. Add 1.0–1.2% of binder to the sand.
2. Dose the catalyst separately at 12–15% of binder weight.
3. Allow the mix to mature for 3–4 minutes before moulding.

> **Tip:** keep sand moisture below 0.2% to maintain consistent reactivity.
