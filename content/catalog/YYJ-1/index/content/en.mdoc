# YYJ-1 — universal graphite-promoting inoculant for cast irons

{% callout title="Brief" %}
Barium-bearing ferrosilicon inoculant. Reduces chill and shrinkage porosity, refines graphite structure and improves machinability of iron castings.
{% /callout %}

YYJ-1 is a ferrosilicon-based inoculant containing barium, calcium and aluminium, designed for complex inoculation of grey and ductile irons. It effectively reduces chill tendency, minimises shrinkage porosity and improves melt fluidity, providing a stable graphite structure and good machinability of castings.

## Application range

- Grey and ductile irons, including alloyed grades.
- Thin- and medium-section castings, green sand, chemically bonded and permanent moulds.

- Ladle or in-stream inoculation when high consistency of microstructure and mechanical properties is required.

## Key benefits

- Strong reduction of chill and hard carbide areas, improving machinability and tool life.

- Lower shrinkage porosity and gas defects, resulting in denser castings.

- Improved fluidity and filling of thin sections and complex cavities.
- Stable inoculation effect at typical holding times between furnace and pouring.
- Suitable for irons containing carbide-stabilising alloying elements.

## Use recommendations

- Applied during ladle or in-stream inoculation; the exact method depends on the foundry practice.
- Recommended addition rate must follow the TU and plant instruction; ferrosilicon inoculants are normally used at fractions of a percent of metal weight.

- Supplied in particle sizes optimised for uniform distribution in the melt (typically 1–3 or 2–6 mm).

## Packaging, storage and safety

YYJ-1 is supplied in standard industrial packaging with appropriate labelling. Store dry and protected from moisture. Use standard PPE when handling ferrosilicon alloys. Full product properties and safety requirements are given in the TU and Technical Description.
