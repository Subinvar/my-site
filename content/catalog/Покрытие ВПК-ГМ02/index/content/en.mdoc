## Application
Water-dilutable graphite coating for moulds and cores based on resin-bonded, sodium-silicate and green-sand mixtures used in grey and ductile iron casting. It forms a lubricating graphite film on the mould surface, effectively protecting against burn-on and metal penetration.

## Key benefits
- Graphite filler creates a smooth, easily removable barrier layer, reducing cleaning and grinding of iron castings.
- Reduces burn-on, penetration and surface defects in thermally loaded areas of iron castings.
- High suspension stability ensures uniform coating thickness on complex cores and throughout long production runs.
- Good flow and coverage for both brushing and spraying; suitable for cores with intricate geometry.
- Water-based system helps lower VOC emissions and workplace odour.

## Typical use
Recommended for grey and ductile iron castings such as pump housings, valves, gearboxes and other components with pronounced hot spots. Can be used in no-bake, sodium-silicate and green-sand processes, as well as for lost-foam models. Before use, the product should be thoroughly mixed and, if needed, adjusted with water to the desired working viscosity, avoiding excessive dilution.
