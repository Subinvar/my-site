## Application
Release coating for cores and moulds based on Cold-Box-Amin sand systems. Designed to ensure easy stripping of complex cores, minimise sand build-up and reduce mechanical stress on core boxes.

## Key benefits
- Formulated for Cold-Box processes with high core-shop productivity.
- Forms an even, very thin film, preserving fine details and tight tolerances.
- Significantly lowers stripping force and risk of core breakage.
- Stable performance in serial production of complex core geometries.
- Reduces cleaning frequency and maintenance time for core boxes.

## Typical use
- Cores and mould elements made with Cold-Box-Amin binder systems.
- Intricate cores with thin sections, deep pockets and narrow undercuts.
- High-volume production where consistent stripping behaviour is critical.

## Directions for use
Mix thoroughly before use. Apply onto clean core box and pattern surfaces by brush or spray to obtain a thin, uniform coating. Allow the solvent to evaporate completely, then proceed with core production. Several cores can typically be produced from one application; re-apply when release performance starts to decrease.

## Typical features (short)
- Application area: Cold-Box-Amin cores and moulds.
- Low gas evolution, supporting good casting surface quality.
- Shelf life: up to 6 months in closed original containers.

## Packaging and storage
Supplied in 20 kg plastic cans. Store in tightly closed containers, in a cool and well-ventilated place, away from heat and ignition sources. Stir before use after prolonged storage.
