# EPS-10 — exothermic insulating cover mix for steel castings

{% callout title="Brief" %}
Exothermic insulating cover powder for steel feeders. Builds a strong insulating layer, extends feeding time and reduces shrinkage defects in steel castings.
{% /callout %}

EPS-10 is an exothermic insulating cover powder designed for open steel feeders and ingots. The low-bulk-density powder forms a dense insulating blanket on the metal surface and develops an exothermic reaction with a heat release of around 7–8 MJ/kg, extending feeder solidification time and improving feeding efficiency.

## Application range

- Carbon and alloy steel castings in moulds and ingot moulds.
- Open feeders of small, medium and heavy steel castings.
- Situations where longer feeding time and reduced shrinkage porosity are required.

## Key benefits

- Combination of exothermic effect and high insulation: feeders cool down more slowly and remain liquid for longer.
- Low bulk density (typically 1.3–1.8 g/cm³) ensures sufficient layer thickness at moderate addition rate.
- Reduced shrinkage cavities and porosity, denser metal structure in the feeder zone.
- Excellent spreading on the metal surface, forming a stable blanket without bare spots.
- Good slag agglomeration, simplifying slag removal.

## Use recommendations

- Add EPS-10 onto the open metal surface immediately after mould or ingot filling is completed.
- Layer thickness and addition rate should be selected according to feeder size and the technological instruction / TU.
- The powder must be distributed evenly over the entire feeder area.

## Packaging, storage and safety

EPS-10 is supplied in industrial packaging suitable for manual or mechanised charging. Store in a dry, well-ventilated area away from heat sources and open flames. Use appropriate personal protective equipment and follow standard foundry safety rules. Detailed properties, storage and safety requirements are given in the product TU and Technical Description.
