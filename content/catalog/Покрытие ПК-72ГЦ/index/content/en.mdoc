# PK-72GC

{% callout title="Brief" %}
Alcohol-based graphite–zircon foundry coating — a standard solution for cast iron: combines strong burn-on protection with a smooth, “slippery” mould surface.
{% /callout %}

## Description

PK-72GC is an alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating with a dual filler system: graphite plus zircon. This combination provides high refractoriness (zircon) and excellent “lubricating” behaviour of the coating layer (graphite). The dried film is grey and forms a uniform layer on moulds and cores, improving the surface quality of cast iron and non-ferrous castings.

## Application

PK-72GC is a standard solution for cast iron — grey, ductile and compacted graphite iron — and for selected non-ferrous alloys. It is recommended for small, medium and large castings where surface cleanliness and stable burn-on protection are important. The coating can be used in no-bake, sodium silicate and green sand processes as the main coating on sand moulds and cores.

## Key properties

- **Type.** Fast-drying alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating.
- **Main fillers.** Graphite and zircon.
- **Coating colour.** Grey.
- **Recommended alloys.** All main types of cast iron, selected non-ferrous alloys; can be used on steel under moderate thermal loads.
- **Moulding processes.** No-bake, sodium silicate, green sand.
- **Application methods.** Brushing, dipping, spraying; suitable for both single-layer and multi-layer coating systems.

## Benefits

- “Gold standard” for cast iron shops: one product covers most everyday applications.
- Combined effect: zircon protects against burn-on, graphite improves release and surface appearance.
- Reduced risk of gas-related and surface defects.
- Easier shakeout and cleaning thanks to a smooth, low-friction coating layer.
