# FS-02

### Application

Special low-viscosity alkaline resin for the Alphaset process. Designed for cold-setting moulds and cores, primarily for small and thin-walled castings and processes with a high share of reclaimed sand.

## Key features and benefits

- Low resin viscosity – ensures uniform sand grain coating and faster sand mixing.
- Improved reclamation: complete burnout in thermal reclamation, increasing the yield of usable reclaimed sand.
- Stable strength at reduced resin addition due to more efficient sand coating.
- Excellent for small and intricate cores where accurate reproduction of complex shapes is required.
- Compatible with the full A-series hardener range, allowing flexible bench-life adjustment.

## Use and recommendations

FS-02 is particularly suitable for small and thin-walled castings in steel, iron and non-ferrous alloys where precise moulding of complex cavities and high detail accuracy are required.

Typical dosage: about 1.0–1.3 % resin on sand and 20–25 % A-series hardener on resin. The low viscosity facilitates operation in continuous mixers and on high-output lines. When using a high proportion of reclaimed sand, it is often possible to reduce resin addition while improving reclamation performance.

## Packaging and storage

Supplied in steel drums and IBC containers (see TDS/specification). Store in tightly closed containers at the temperature range specified in the TDS, protected from moisture, freezing and overheating. Before use after extended storage, mix the resin.
