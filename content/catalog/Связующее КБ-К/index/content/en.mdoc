# KB-K

{% product-header %}
### Application
KB-K is a triethylamine-based gaseous catalyst for the Cold-Box-amin process. It is used to cure KB-A / KB-B and KB-A(E) / KB-B(E) binder systems in core and mould production.

## Key features and benefits

- **High reactivity.** Ensures fast, through-section curing of cores at short gassing times.   
- **Binder-independent flexibility.** Compatible with both the standard and eco-optimised Intema Cold-Box binder systems, as well as with a wide range of phenolic Cold-Box binders.   
- **Adjustable consumption.** The recommended dosage range allows fine-tuning of curing speed for different core sizes, geometries and operating conditions.   
- **Consistent quality.** Minimum triethylamine content of 98.8 % guarantees stable performance from batch to batch.

## Use and recommendations

- **Dosage.**  
  - Typical consumption: 0.5–1.5 kg of catalyst per tonne of sand.  
  - Exact amount depends on equipment type, core size and geometry, sand and ambient temperature (lower end of the range in summer, higher in winter).   

- **Gassing parameters.**  
  - Amine gassing pressure generally 0.05–0.3 MPa, within the equipment’s operating window.  
  - Gassing time typically 2–6 s and should be slightly longer than the sand-blowing time.  
  - To improve working environment, the evacuation time of the gas-air mixture is recommended to be at least 2–3 times longer than the gassing time.   

- **Binder systems.**  
  - Fully compatible with KB-A / KB-B and KB-A(E) / KB-B(E) systems; operating parameters are adjusted according to required strength and core geometry.

- [KB-A(E) / KB-B(E) binders](/catalog/kb-ae-be)

## Packaging and storage

- **Packaging.** Steel drums with a capacity of 200–275 dm³; for small quantities, glass bottles of 10–20 dm³ are allowed.   
- **Transport.** In accordance with current dangerous goods transport regulations, including the option of dedicated road tankers.   
- **Storage.** Store in tightly closed containers in covered, ventilated warehouses; heated during winter, at least 1 m away from heat sources.
