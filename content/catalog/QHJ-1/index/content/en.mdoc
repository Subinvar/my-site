# QHJ-1 — baseline nodulariser for ductile iron

{% callout title="Brief" %}
Magnesium-based nodulariser for ductile iron. Provides high nodularity and consistent mechanical properties in ladle treatment.
{% /callout %}

QHJ-1 is a magnesium-based nodulariser on a ferrosilicon base, alloyed with rare earth elements and calcium. It is designed for ladle treatment when producing ductile iron with a stable nodular graphite structure. The balanced Mg and RE content ensures an active yet controllable reaction with good magnesium recovery and limited spatter when used correctly.

## Application range

- Production of ductile iron in small and medium-size ladles.
- General engineering castings, pipes and housings requiring high strength and ductility.
- Standard practice with normal sulphur levels and typical pouring temperatures.

## Key benefits

- High graphite nodularity when recommended treatment practice is followed.
- Good magnesium recovery and stable residual Mg levels.
- Controlled reaction behaviour, with moderate fume and spatter.
- Presence of rare earths and calcium helps refine inclusions and further improve microstructure.

## Use recommendations

- Applied in ladle treatment: the nodulariser is placed into the ladle (sandwich, tundish-cover or similar process).
- Addition rate and contact time must follow the TU and foundry procedures.
- Proper cover of the alloy charge and sufficient metal head are essential for safe operation and high Mg recovery.

## Packaging, storage and safety

QHJ-1 is supplied as 5–20 or 10–25 mm granules in industrial packaging. Store dry and protect from moisture. Use PPE and follow standard precautions for handling magnesium-containing alloys. Full details are given in the TU and Technical Description.
