## Application
Liquid cleaner designed to remove cured resin and sand–resin deposits from core boxes, patterns and other foundry equipment. Softens and loosens build-up without attacking the metallic surface or changing tooling geometry.

## Key benefits
- Fast dissolution of cured resin films and deposits.
- Protects tooling surface: no noticeable erosion or etching of metal.
- Easy local application with a brush on heavily contaminated areas.
- Reduces manual cleaning time and equipment downtime.
- Stable performance under typical shop-floor temperatures.

## Typical use
- Cleaning of core boxes and mould equipment in no-bake (cold-setting) processes.
- Removal of resin deposits after Cold-Box operations.
- Washing of mixers, moulding machines and auxiliary tooling.
- Preventive cleaning of equipment when changing binder or sand recipes.

## Directions for use
Apply the cleaner with a brush onto the contaminated surface and allow it to act until the resin layer is softened. Remove loosened deposits with a metal scraper or brush, then rinse the treated area with water and let it dry before restarting the equipment.

## Typical properties (short)
- Appearance: liquid from colourless to light yellow, slight odour.
- Density at 20 °C: approx. 0.90–1.05 g/cm³.

## Packaging and storage
Supplied in 20 kg plastic cans. Store in tightly closed original containers, in a dry and well-ventilated area, away from heat sources and open flames. Shelf life — according to the current technical documentation.
