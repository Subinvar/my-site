# PK-50A

{% callout title="Brief" %}
Alcohol-based zircon foundry coating for demanding steel and critical cast iron castings, providing an exceptionally clean surface even in heavy hot spots.
{% /callout %}

## Description

PK-50A is a fast-drying, alcohol-based foundry coating with fine zircon filler. It forms a strong, highly refractory barrier layer that protects sand moulds and cores from thermal and chemical burn-on when pouring steel and other alloys. The dried coating layer has a bluish or yellowish-white shade, making it easy to visually control uniformity of application.

## Application

PK-50A is recommended wherever the highest surface quality of castings is required: steel castings (including large and heavy sections), critical cast iron parts and non-ferrous alloy castings. The coating performs well in various moulding processes (no-bake, CO₂/alkaline and green sand) and is particularly effective in areas with heavy hot spots and zones prone to burn-on. It can be used as a stand-alone coating or in combination with chromite-based products in two-layer “zircon + chromite” systems.

## Key properties

- **Type.** Fast-drying alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating.
- **Main refractory filler.** Fine zircon.
- **Coating colour.** Bluish or yellowish-white.
- **Recommended alloys.** Steel (small, medium and large castings), manganese steel, cast iron, non-ferrous alloys.
- **Moulding processes.** No-bake, sodium silicate and green sand systems.
- **Application methods.** Brushing, dipping, spraying; can be used to build penetrating and cover layers.
- **Guaranteed shelf life.** At least 6 months under proper storage conditions (as per TU).

## Benefits

- Maximum burn-on protection on steel and other high-temperature alloys thanks to zircon filler.
- Consistently excellent casting surface quality, reducing grinding and cleaning costs.
- Reliable performance in heavy hot spots and large steel castings.
- Wide process and alloy window — one product covers most typical foundry tasks.
