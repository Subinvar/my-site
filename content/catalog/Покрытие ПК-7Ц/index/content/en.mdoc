# PK-7C

{% callout title="Brief" %}
High-viscosity alcohol-based zircon coating that provides a smooth “cream-like” layer without runs or streaks and reliably protects steel, cast iron and non-ferrous castings against burn-on.
{% /callout %}

## Description

PK-7C is an alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating with fine zircon filler and increased initial viscosity. Due to its rheology, it is applied to moulds and cores as a dense, “cream-like” layer with virtually no runs or streaks, even on complex geometries. After drying, it forms a strong refractory film that performs reliably when pouring steel, cast iron and non-ferrous alloys.

## Application

PK-7C is designed for a wide range of foundry applications: steel castings (including large sections), manganese steels, cast iron and non-ferrous alloys. In the internal selection table it is recommended for all main alloy groups, from steel to non-ferrous metals. Thanks to its high viscosity and plastic layer behaviour, it is especially convenient for coating complex cavities and vertical surfaces where uniform coverage and absence of drips are critical.

## Key properties

- **Type.** Fast-drying alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating.
- **Main filler.** Zircon.
- **Coating colour.** Light grey.
- **Recommended alloys.** Steel (small, medium and large castings), manganese steel, cast iron, non-ferrous alloys.
- **Rheology.** High initial viscosity, must be diluted with alcohol to the working range; when prepared correctly, gives a smooth, continuous layer.
- **Application methods.** Brushing, spraying, dipping; can be used both as penetrating and as cover coat in multi-layer systems.

## Benefits

- Forms an exceptionally smooth layer without runs or streaks, ideal for demanding surfaces.
- Easy to use on vertical and complex mould areas thanks to its thixotropic behaviour.
- Universal alloy coverage — one product for steel, cast iron and non-ferrous castings.
- Reduces surface defects and the amount of grinding and finishing operations.
