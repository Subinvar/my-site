## Application
Release coating for moulds and cores made from green sand and clay-bonded moulding mixtures. Designed to facilitate stripping, improve casting surface finish and reduce the risk of mould damage during shake-out.

## Key benefits
- Reliable release behaviour on conventional green sand systems.
- Noticeably lower extraction forces and fewer surface defects on castings.
- Several pours possible after one application under normal operating conditions.
- Non-flammable formulation for convenient and safe use.
- Robust performance in continuous and serial production.

## Typical use
- Moulds and cores based on standard clay-bonded sand mixtures.
- Iron and steel castings produced on lines with mechanical shake-out.
- Applications where consistent stripping and good surface quality are critical.

## Directions for use
Apply onto clean mould surfaces by brush or spray to obtain a thin, uniform layer. Use the product as supplied, without dilution. After application, fill the mould with the sand mix and proceed with pouring; under normal conditions, multiple castings can be produced before re-applying the coating.

## Typical features (short)
- Application area: green sand and similar moulding systems.
- Provides improved casting surface finish and stable release behaviour.
- Simple to use, does not require complex preparation.

## Packaging and storage
Supplied in cans (typically 20 kg) or other container sizes on request. Store in tightly closed original packaging, under recommended temperature conditions, in a dry and well-ventilated area. Typical shelf life is about 6 months.
