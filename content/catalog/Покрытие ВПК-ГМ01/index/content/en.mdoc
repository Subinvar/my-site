## Application
Water-dilutable anti-penetration coating based on aluminosilicate filler for moulds and cores made of resin-bonded, sodium-silicate and green-sand mixtures, as well as EPS patterns in lost-foam casting. Designed for steel and non-ferrous castings where a stable barrier against burn-on is required.

## Key benefits
- Water-based system — no organic solvent, reduced odour and lower load on the ventilation system.
- Aluminosilicate filler provides a balanced combination of refractoriness and permeability, minimizing metal penetration and surface defects.
- High sedimentation stability ensures a uniform suspension and even coating thickness throughout the batch.
- Excellent adhesion to moulds and cores based on CB/no-bake, sodium-silicate and green-sand processes; the layer withstands handling and pouring without flaking.
- Viscosity can be adjusted with water to reach the required working consistency without sacrificing protective properties (if not over-diluted).

## Typical use
Recommended for steel and non-ferrous castings, including medium and heavy sections with increased requirements to surface finish and cleaning. Applied in cold-setting and sodium-silicate processes, green sand and lost-foam moulds and cores. The coating is applied by brushing, spraying or dipping; it must be thoroughly mixed before use and diluted with water only to the target working density.
