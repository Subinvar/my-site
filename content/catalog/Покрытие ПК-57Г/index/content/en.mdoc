# PK-57G

{% callout title="Brief" %}
Alcohol-based graphite–iron oxide foundry coating for cast iron castings; provides a strong, heat-resistant layer and stable surface quality on complex parts.
{% /callout %}

## Description

PK-57G is an alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating with graphite and iron oxides as its main fillers. Graphite provides a smooth, low-friction surface, while iron oxides increase the heat resistance of the coating and improve its resistance to cracking under cyclic thermal loads. The dried film has a brown shade, which contrasts well with the sand and allows easy visual inspection of the coated surfaces.

## Application

PK-57G is primarily intended for cast iron castings, especially parts with complex geometry, deep cavities and variable wall thickness. It is suitable for small and medium castings where both surface quality and resistance of the coating to thermal shock are important. The product can be used in no-bake, sodium silicate and green sand processes and performs well on general engineering castings and other critical components.

## Key properties

- **Type.** Fast-drying alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating.
- **Main fillers.** Graphite and iron oxide.
- **Coating colour.** Brown.
- **Recommended alloys.** Cast iron (small and medium castings), optional use on non-ferrous alloys.
- **Moulding processes.** No-bake, sodium silicate, green sand.
- **Application methods.** Brushing, dipping, spraying; well suited for vertical and complex mould surfaces.

## Benefits

- Strong, heat-resistant layer with good resistance to cracking under repeated pours.
- High surface quality on complex cast iron parts.
- Fewer burn-on and local overheating defects.
- Easy visual control of coating quality due to the contrasting brown colour.
