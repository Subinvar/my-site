# KB-AE-BE

{% product-header %}
### Application
KB-A(E) / KB-B(E) is a two-component Cold-Box-amin binder system with an aliphatic solvent, designed for foundries that require higher core strength and improved workplace conditions (lower odour and reduced VOC emissions).
{% /product-header %}

## Key features and benefits

- **Higher core strength.** Optimised formulation with an aliphatic solvent provides higher initial and final strengths compared to the standard KB-A / KB-B system at comparable binder addition.  
- **Reduced odour and VOCs.** Partial replacement of aromatic solvent with aliphatic solvent leads to noticeably lower smell in the core shop and less load on ventilation systems.  
- **Flexibility in consumption.** Higher strength allows, where appropriate, to slightly reduce binder addition without sacrificing core quality.  
- **Fully compatible with KB-K catalyst.** Uses the same triethylamine-based catalyst as the standard system; the overall process scheme remains unchanged.   
- **For demanding castings.** Recommended for critical steel and iron castings where low gas-related and surface defects and better working environment are important.

## Typical properties

> Numerical values (viscosity, free formaldehyde, shelf life) should be taken from the dedicated TU for KB-A(E) / KB-B(E). Below is a template structure:

## Use and recommendations

- **Applications.**  
  - Steel and high-strength iron castings with stringent surface and dimensional requirements.  
  - Shops with strict industrial hygiene and odour limitations.  

- **Binder addition.**  
  - Total binder addition in the same range as for KB-A / KB-B (approx. 0.4–0.8 % of sand weight), with KB-A(E) and KB-B(E) dosed at roughly 1:1.  
  - In many cases, the higher strength allows a moderate reduction of total binder addition after optimisation on the production line.

- **Process.**  
  - Mixing sequence and amine gassing scheme are the same as for KB-A / KB-B.  
  - KB-K (triethylamine) is used as the catalyst, with typical pressure and gassing times adjusted to core size and equipment.   

## Recommended catalyst

- [KB-K catalyst](/catalog/kb-k)

## Packaging and storage

- Packaging and transport/storage requirements are equivalent to the standard KB-A / KB-B system: steel drums, tightly closed, protected from moisture and overheating, in accordance with general regulations for organic-solvent-based binders.
