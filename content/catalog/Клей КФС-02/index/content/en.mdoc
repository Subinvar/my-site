## Application
KFS-02 is a highly plastic red adhesive paste supplied in soft blocks. It is designed for bonding and local repair of sand molds and cores, especially where small gaps or defects need to be filled and sealed.

## Key benefits
- High bond strength on sands with sodium-silicate or resin binders (same application range as KFS-01).
- Increased plasticity makes it easy to shape the required amount and fill gaps.
- Red colour helps visually control application thickness and coverage.
- Supplied in soft blocks that are simple to portion and knead by hand.
- Low gas generation, so it does not cause porosity or blowholes in the casting.

## How to use
Cut off the required amount of paste from the block, knead it until soft and apply to the bonding or repair area (mold joint, crack, chipped corner). Press the mold parts together and allow the adhesive to cure. Typical uses include bonding two halves of cores and inserts, filling cracks and surface defects, and locally sealing mold joints in risk areas.

## Typical technical data
- Appearance: red plastic paste.
- Consistency: ready to use, no additional dilution required.
- Base: heat-resistant mineral filler + silicate/resin binder (by analogy with KFS-01).

## Packaging and storage
KFS-02 is supplied in soft blocks packed into cardboard boxes. Store in original closed packaging in a dry place, avoiding overheating and direct sunlight.
