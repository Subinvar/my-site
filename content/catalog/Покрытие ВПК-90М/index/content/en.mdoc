## Application
Water-dilutable anti-penetration coating with magnesite filler for sand moulds and cores used in high-manganese steel casting. It is designed for extremely severe thermal and chemical loads typical of such alloys.

## Key benefits
- Magnesite filler provides excellent resistance to aggressive high-manganese steels and elevated pouring temperatures.
- Reduces burn-on, penetration and surface cracking of the mould in the most highly stressed areas.
- High sedimentation stability and robust layer structure when the working suspension is prepared correctly.
- Applicable in green-sand, sodium-silicate and no-bake processes, allowing one grade to be used across different moulding technologies.
- Water-based system supports compliance with safety and environmental standards.

## Typical use
Recommended for high-manganese steel castings, e.g. components of crushing and mining equipment operating under heavy impact-abrasive conditions. Applied to mould and core areas subjected to maximum thermal and chemical attack. The product is thoroughly mixed, adjusted with water to the specified working density and applied by brushing, spraying or dipping.
