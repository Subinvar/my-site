# PK-55H

{% callout title="Brief" %}
Alcohol-based chromite coating with a local “chilling” effect: for hot spots in steel and cast iron castings or as an alternative to chromite sand.
{% /callout %}

## Description

PK-55H is an alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating with chromite as the main filler. It forms a dense, dark refractory layer with increased thermal conductivity and heat capacity. As a result, the coating provides a pronounced local “chilling” effect: it accelerates heat extraction in the coated areas and promotes a finer metal structure in hot spots.

## Application

PK-55H is intended for local protection of hot sections in steel and cast iron castings: heavy bosses, areas under risers, transitions from thick to thin walls and other regions with concentrated thermal load. It can be used as a partial substitute for chromite sand: applying a chromite coating onto quartz sand allows the foundry to reduce chromite sand consumption. The product is suitable for no-bake, sodium silicate and green sand processes in steel and cast iron foundries.

## Key properties

- **Type.** Fast-drying alcohol-based chromite anti-burn-on coating.
- **Main filler.** Chromite.
- **Coating colour.** Dark grey / black.
- **Recommended alloys.** Steel and cast iron, especially in thick sections and hot spots.
- **Moulding processes.** No-bake, sodium silicate, green sand.
- **Application methods.** Local brushing, tamping, spraying; can be used alone or in combination with other coatings.

## Benefits

- Pronounced local chilling effect in coated zones.
- Reduced risk of shrinkage defects, burn-on and cracking in hot spots.
- Potential savings on chromite sand by using localized chromite coating over quartz sand.
- Improved consistency of metal structure and surface quality in problematic sections of castings.
