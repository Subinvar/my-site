## Application
Water-dilutable anti-penetration coating for moulds and cores used in iron casting. A combination of graphite and zircon fillers provides both high refractoriness and easy cleaning of the casting surface.

## Key benefits
- Graphite + zircon system: zircon protects against burn-on and penetration, while graphite facilitates shake-out and reduces grinding time.
- Suitable for green-sand, sodium-silicate and cold-setting (no-bake) processes, covering the majority of typical foundry moulding systems.
- High sedimentation stability ensures a homogeneous suspension and consistent coating performance.
- Water-based formulation reduces odour and safety risks compared with alcohol coatings.
- Available as paste or powder, adaptable to different on-site preparation schemes.

## Typical use
Applied to moulds and cores for grey and ductile iron castings such as pump housings, valves, machine beds and other components where a clean surface and controlled fettling are important. The product is mixed and diluted with water to the required density (Baumé) before brushing, spraying or dipping, avoiding over-dilution that could reduce coverage and stability.
