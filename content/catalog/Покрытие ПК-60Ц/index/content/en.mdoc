{% callout title="Brief" %}
Alcohol-based zircon coating for steel and cast iron castings, providing reliable anti-burn-on protection and a smooth surface finish for standard quality requirements.
{% /callout %}

## Description

PK-60C is a classic alcohol-based zircon anti-burn-on coating for day-to-day foundry use. It forms a strong refractory layer on sand moulds and cores, preventing direct contact between molten metal and sand and reducing both thermal and chemical burn-on. The dried coating has a yellowish-white colour, which helps visually control layer thickness and uniformity.

## Application

PK-60C is recommended for steel and cast iron castings of small and medium size, as well as for certain non-ferrous alloys. According to the internal application table it provides reliable burn-on protection for steel (including larger castings) and cast iron, and can be used on non-ferrous alloys where standard surface quality is required. It is suitable for typical moulding processes (no-bake, sodium silicate, green sand) as a universal “workhorse” coating.

## Key properties

- **Type.** General purpose, fast-drying alcohol-based anti-burn-on coating.
- **Main filler.** Zircon.
- **Coating colour.** Yellowish-white.
- **Recommended alloys.** Steel (small and large castings), cast iron, optional use on non-ferrous alloys.
- **Moulding processes.** No-bake, sodium silicate and green sand systems.
- **Application methods.** Brushing, spraying, dipping; can be used within two-layer systems (penetrating/top coat).

## Benefits

- Versatile “everyday” product for most steel and cast iron casting jobs.
- Stable burn-on protection when standard preparation, application and drying procedures are followed.
- Good refractoriness and resistance to coating cracking.
- Attractive cost-to-performance ratio for high-volume foundry production.
