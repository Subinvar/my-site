## Application
Water-dilutable zircon-based anti-penetration coating for moulds and cores used in cold-setting (no-bake), sodium-silicate, green-sand and lost-foam processes. Intended for carbon steel and iron castings where maximum layer refractoriness and surface cleanliness are required.

## Key benefits
- Zircon filler delivers high refractoriness and thermal-shock resistance, protecting moulds and cores during long pouring times and elevated metal temperatures.
- Strong barrier against metal penetration, veining and burn-on on steel and iron castings.
- Excellent suspension stability — the product remains homogeneous, ensuring a dense and uniform layer.
- Good penetration into sand surface and consistent finish even on complex cores, gating systems and riser areas.
- Water-based formulation improves safety, simplifies handling and reduces ventilation requirements compared with alcohol-based coatings.

## Typical use
Recommended for carbon steel, ductile and grey iron castings with stringent requirements for tightness and surface quality (pressure housings, turbine and power-engineering components, flanges, etc.). Applied to moulds and cores in areas exposed to high thermal load and severe metal-mould interaction. The coating can be applied by brushing, spraying or dipping; density is adjusted with water to the working level, avoiding excessive dilution that could reduce protection.
