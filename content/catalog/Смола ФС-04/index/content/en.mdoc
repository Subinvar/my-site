# FS-04

### Application

Special Alphaset resin for large and heavy steel and iron castings. Provides improved mould compliance during pouring and reduces the risk of hot cracking and internal stresses in heavy sections.

## Key features and benefits

- Optimised mould behaviour at elevated temperatures – the mould can accommodate metal expansion, reducing internal stress.
- Increased hot strength with controlled binder breakdown during cooling.
- Lower risk of hot cracking and thermal defects in heavy castings.
- Extended bench life when used with slower A-series hardeners (A-20, A-30, A-60).
- Good shake-out of large moulds after full cooling of the casting.

| Free formaldehyde                 | <!-- value from TDS --> | low level                           |
| Recommended resin addition        | <!-- range from TDS --> | % on sand (towards upper range)     |

## Use and recommendations

FS-04 is recommended for large and heavy steel and iron castings such as machine beds, casings and massive components sensitive to hot cracking. Best results are obtained in combination with slower A-series hardeners, which provide extended bench life and sufficient time for ramming and assembling large moulds.

Resin dosage is typically at the upper end of the range specified in the TDS, with hardener dosage of 20–25 % on resin. Bench life and strip time depend on the selected hardener grade and sand temperature; process trials on the specific line are recommended.

## Packaging and storage

Supplied in steel drums and IBC containers (see TDS/specification). Store in tightly closed containers at the specified temperature range, avoiding freezing and overheating. Protect from direct sunlight and sudden temperature changes. Mix thoroughly before use to ensure homogeneity. Shelf life – according to the current specification.
