# QHJ-2 — nodulariser for low-sulphur irons and large ladles

{% callout title="Brief" %}
Low-magnesium nodulariser for gentle treatment of low-sulphur irons and large ladles, providing controlled reaction and stable nodularity.
{% /callout %}

QHJ-2 is a NODULANT-type nodulariser with slightly reduced magnesium and rare earth content compared to QHJ-1. This composition provides a gentler reaction, making it suitable for low-sulphur base irons, larger ladles and higher metal temperatures.

## Application range

- Ductile iron produced from low-sulphur, well-deoxidised base irons.
- Medium- and large-capacity ladles where controlled metal rise and limited fume are required.
- Critical components sensitive to inclusion content and residual Mg variations.

## Key benefits

- Smoother magnesium reaction while maintaining required graphite nodularity.
- Reduced risk of overtreatment and excessive residual magnesium.
- Effective inclusion control due to rare earth and calcium additions.
- Comfortable handling under demanding shop conditions.

## Use recommendations

- Treatment practice is similar to QHJ-1; the choice between QHJ-1 / QHJ-2 / QHJ-3 depends on base iron chemistry and temperature.
- Addition rate and processing parameters must follow TU and foundry procedures.
- For low-sulphur irons, QHJ-2 often allows some reduction of alloy consumption.

## Packaging, storage and safety

Supplied as standard 5–20 / 10–25 mm granules. Storage and safety requirements are the same as for other NODULANT products; full details are given in the TU and Technical Description of QHJ-2.
