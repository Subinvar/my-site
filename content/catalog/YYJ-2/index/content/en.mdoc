# YYJ-2 — high-efficiency inoculant for demanding iron castings

{% callout title="Brief" %}
High-intensity barium ferrosilicon inoculant. Provides strong anti-chill effect and reliable inoculation of complex and thin-wall iron castings.
{% /callout %}

YYJ-2 is a ferrosilicon inoculant with increased barium and aluminium content compared to YYJ-1. This composition provides a stronger anti-chill effect and better fading resistance, which is critical for thin-wall, complex and high-strength iron castings.

## Application range

- Grey, compacted graphite and ductile irons.
- Thin-wall and complex castings with varying section thickness.
- Alloyed irons prone to carbide formation and hard, high-carbon phases.

## Key benefits

- Strong anti-chill performance, minimising white and brittle areas across the section.

- Reduced shrinkage and gas porosity, especially in thin and poorly fed zones.

- Stable inoculation effect even with longer holding times between treatment and pouring.
- Improved structural uniformity, higher impact toughness and fatigue strength.
- Compatible with a wide range of moulding materials and pouring processes.

## Use recommendations

- Application scheme is similar to YYJ-1: ladle or in-stream inoculation.
- Addition rate and timing are defined by the TU and plant practice; in many cases YYJ-2 is used closer to the upper end of the typical range for ferrosilicon inoculants.

- Standard particle sizes (e.g. 1–3 or 2–6 mm) are used, selected according to ladle size and feeding method.

## Packaging, storage and safety

YYJ-2 is supplied in industrial packaging with proper labelling. Store dry and protect from moisture. Follow standard safety precautions for handling ferrosilicon alloys. Full details are given in the TU and Technical Description.
