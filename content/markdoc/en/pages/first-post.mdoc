# Digitally transforming the coating line

We relied on a digital twin and flow simulations to identify bottlenecks early and stage the equipment swap without stopping production.

## Key steps

- Laser-scanned the shop floor and built a precise 3D model.
- Deployed live monitoring to watch energy, temperature, and paint usage.
- Trained operators and handed over a preventative maintenance playbook.
